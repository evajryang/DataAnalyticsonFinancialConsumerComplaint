### Managerial Insights:
- [x] To CFPB:
Make more issue/sub-issue subjects for most disputed products, and thus to avoid the misunderstanding.
- [x] To banks:
They need to strictly audit the users who need non federal loans, which can effectively reduce the complaint rate and even reduce the risk of default.
- [x] To public services:
Establish an unified platform for all parties including CFPB, regulator and companies would help reduce the complaint response time to streamline the process.
